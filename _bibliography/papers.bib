  abstract={The recent demonstration of resonant tunneling transport in nitride semiconductors has led to an invigorated effort to harness this quantum transport regime for practical applications. In polar semiconductors, however, the interplay between fixed polarization charges and mobile free carriers leads to asymmetric transport characteristics. Here, we investigate the possibility of using degenerately doped contact layers to screen the built-in polarization fields and recover symmetric resonant injection. Thanks to a high doping density, negative differential conductance is observed under both bias polarities of GaN/AlN resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs). Moreover, our analytical model reveals a lower bound for the minimum resonant-tunneling voltage achieved via uniform doping, owing to the dopant solubility limit. Charge storage dynamics is also studied by impedance measurements, showing that at close-to-equilibrium conditions, polar RTDs behave effectively as parallel-plate capacitors. These mechanisms are completely reproduced by our analytical model, providing a theoretical framework useful in the design and analysis of polar resonant-tunneling devices.}

  abstract={This report showcases a vertical tunnel field effect transistor (TFET) fabricated from a GaN/InGaN heterostructure and compares it to a gated vertical GaN p-n diode. By including a thin InGaN layer, the interband tunneling in the TFET is increased compared to the gated homojunction diode. This leads to an increased drain current of 57 μA/μm and a reduced subthreshold swing of 102 mV/dec, from 240 mV/dec. However, trap assisted tunneling prevents devices from realizing subthreshold slopes below the Boltzmann limit of 60 mV/dec. Nevertheless, this work shows the capability of tunnel field effect transistors to be realized in GaN by taking advantage of the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization in the III-N material system.}

  abstract={During the last two decades, a considerable effort has been dedicated to engineer resonant tunneling transport within the family of III-Nitride semiconductors. At the heart of this initiative, lies the outstanding material properties that this revolutionary family of semiconductors offers for manufacturing high-power ultra-fast oscillators and terahertz quantum cascade lasers that operate at room temperature. Despite these efforts, it is only recently that room temperature resonant tunneling transport has been demonstrated within III-Nitride materials. In this chapter we discuss various aspects of heterostructure design, epitaxial growth and device fabrication, which have led to the first unequivocal demonstration of robust resonant tunneling transport, and reliable room temperature negative differential conductance resulting in the generation of GHz oscillations in III-Nitride semiconductors. These advances allowed us to shed light into the physics of resonant tunneling transport in polar semiconductors which had remained hidden until now. This insight was obtained using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, leading to the discovery of new tunneling features, unique in polar RTDs. After identifying the intimate connection between the polarization fields and the resonant tunneling current, we harness this relationship by introducing a completely new approach to measure the magnitude of these internal polarization fields. Moreover, precise epitaxial growth at the single-monolayer level is employed to engineer resonant tunneling currents >200 kA/cm2 and demonstrate the first microwave oscillator driven by a GaN/AlN resonant tunneling diode.The findings presented in this chapter pave the way for the realization of III-Nitride-based high-speed oscillators and quantum cascade lasers that operate at wavelengths that remain unreachable by other semiconductor materials.},

  abstract={The phenomenon of resonant tunneling transport through polar double-barrier heterostructures is systematically investigated by a combined experimental and theoretical approach. On the experimental side, GaN/AlN resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. In situ electron diffraction is used to monitor the number of monolayers incorporated into each tunneling barrier of the RTD active region. Using this precise epitaxial control at the monolayer level, we demonstrate exponential modulation of the resonant tunneling current density as a function of barrier thickness. At the same time, both the peak voltage and the characteristic threshold bias exhibit a dependence on barrier thickness as a result of the intense electric fields present within the polar heterostructures. To get further insight into the asymmetric tunneling injection originating from the polar active region, we present an analytical theory for tunneling transport across polar heterostructures. A general expression for the resonant tunneling current that includes contributions from coherent and sequential tunneling processes is introduced. After the application of this theory to the case of GaN/AlN RTDs, their experimental current-voltage characteristics are reproduced over both bias polarities, with tunneling currents spanning several orders of magnitude. This agreement allows us to elucidate the effect of the internal polarization fields on the magnitude of the tunneling current and broadening of the resonant tunneling line shape. Under reverse bias, we identify new tunneling features originating from highly attenuated resonant tunneling phenomena, which are completely captured by our model. The analytical form of our quantum transport model provides a simple expression that reveals the connection between the design parameters of a general polar RTD and its current-voltage characteristics. This new theory paves the way for the design of polar resonant tunneling devices exhibiting efficient resonant current injection and enhanced tunneling dynamics as required in various practical applications.},

  abstract={The outstanding material properties of III-Nitride semiconductors, has prompted intense research efforts in order to engineer resonant tunneling transport within this revolutionary family of wide-bandgap semiconductors. From resonant tunneling diode (RTD) oscillators to quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), III-Nitride heterostructures hold the promise for the realization of high-power ultra-fast sources of terahertz (THz) radiation. However, despite the considerable efforts over last two decades, it is only during the last three years that room temperature resonant tunneling transport has been demonstrated within the III-Nitride family of semiconductors. In this paper we present an overview of our current understanding of resonant tunneling transport in polar heterostructures. In particular we focus on double-barrier III-Nitride RTDs which represents the simplest device in which the dramatic effects of the internal polarization fields can be studied. Tunneling transport within III-heterostructures is strongly influenced by the presence of the intense spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields which result from the non-centrosymmetric crystal structure of III-Nitride semiconductors. Advances in heterostructure design, epitaxial growth and device fabrication have led to the first unequivocal demonstration of robust and reliable negative differential conductance. which has been employed for the generation of microwave power from III-Nitride RTD oscillator. These significant advances allowed us to shed light into the physics of resonant tunneling transport in polar semiconductors which had remained hidden until now.}

In contrast to the commonly employed grating-gate configurations, the analyzed structure contains periodically patterned ohmic contacts to the two-dimensional electron gas, which are laid-out parallel to the gate fingers. In this structure, the terahertz to plasmon coupling mechanism is fundamentally different from that in grating-gate configurations. Whereas the grating-gate configuration constitutes a coupled resonant system in which the resonance frequency depends on the grating periodicity, when periodical ohmic contacts are incorporated, the system behaves as a synchronized resonant system in which each unit cell is effectively independent. As a result, in a HEMT-array, the resonance is no longer set by the periodicity but rather by the gate and the ungated region length. Experimental results of fabricated samples compare well with numerical simulations and theoretical expectations. Our work demonstrates that the proposed approach allows: (i) more efficient excitation of high order plasmon modes and (ii) superior overall terahertz to plasmon coupling, even in configurations having less number of devices per unit area. From this perspective, our results reveal a simple way to enhance the terahertz to plasmon coupling and thus improve the performance of electron plasma wave-based devices; this effect can be exploited, for example, to improve the response of HEMT-based terahertz detectors.},

  abstract ={We report the generation of room temperature microwave oscillations from GaN/AlN resonant tunneling diodes, which exhibit record-high peak current densities. The tunneling heterostructure grown by molecular beam epitaxy on freestanding GaN substrates comprises a thin GaN quantum well embedded between two AlN tunneling barriers. The room temperature current-voltage characteristics exhibit a record-high maximum peak current density of ∼220 kA/cm<sup>2</sup>. When biased within the negative differential conductance region, microwave oscillations are measured with a fundamental frequency of ∼0.94 GHz, generating an output power of ∼3.0 μW. Both the fundamental frequency and the output power of the oscillator are limited by the external biasing circuit. Using a small-signal equivalent circuit model, the maximum intrinsic frequency of oscillation for these diodes is predicted to be ∼200 GHz. This work represents a significant step towards microwave power generation enabled by resonant tunneling transport, an ultra-fast process that goes beyond the limitations of current III-Nitride high electron mobility transistors.},

  abstract ={For the past two decades, repeatable resonant tunneling transport of electrons in III-nitride double barrier heterostructures has remained elusive at room temperature. In this work we theoretically and experimentally study III-nitride double-barrier resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs), the quantum transport characteristics of which exhibit new features that are unexplainable using existing semiconductor theory. The repeatable and robust resonant transport in our devices enables us to track the origin of these features to the broken inversion symmetry in the uniaxial crystal structure, which generates built-in spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields. Resonant tunneling transport enabled by the ground state as well as by the first excited state is demonstrated for the first time over a wide temperature window in planar III-nitride RTDs. An analytical transport model for polar resonant tunneling heterostructures is introduced for the first time, showing a good quantitative agreement with experimental data. From this model we realize that tunneling transport is an extremely sensitive measure of the built-in polarization fields. Since such electric fields play a crucial role in the design of electronic and photonic devices, but are difficult to measure, our work provides a completely new method to accurately determine their magnitude for the entire class of polar heterostructures.},

PZAse is a metalloenzyme that coordinates in vitro different divalent metal cofactors in the metal coordination site (MCS). Several metals including Co2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ are able to reactivate the metal-depleted PZAse in vitro. We use quantum mechanical calculations to investigate the Zn2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ metal cofactor effects on the local MCS structure, metal–ligand or metal–residue binding energy, and charge distribution. Results suggest that the major metal-dependent changes occur in the metal–ligand binding energy and charge distribution. Zn2+ shows the highest binding energy to the ligands (residues). In addition, Zn2+ and Mn2+ within the PZAse MCS highly polarize the O–H bond of coordinated water molecules in comparison with Fe2+. This suggests that the coordination of Zn2+ or Mn2+ to the PZAse protein facilitates the deprotonation of coordinated water to generate a nucleophile for catalysis as in carboxypeptidase A. Because metal ion binding is relevant to enzymatic reaction, identification of the metal binding event is important. The infrared vibrational mode shift of the C═Nε (His) bond from the M. tuberculosis MCS is the best IR probe to metal complexation.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
