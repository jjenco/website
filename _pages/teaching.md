I have thought the following courses.

#### The University of Notre Dame

- Course: __Integrated Circuit Fabrication__. Instructor: [Prof. Gregory Snider](https://engineering.nd.edu/profiles/gsnider). <br> I was responsible for grading the problem sets submitted by undergraduate students.
- Course: __Quantum Computing__. Instructor: [Prof. Anthony Hoffman](https://engineering.nd.edu/profiles/hanthony). <br> I was responsible for grading the students' homework as well as holding two-hour problem sessions each week. I solved a few selected problems for the students and absolve any questions they had about their homework problems.

#### Cornell University

- Course: __Introduction to Circuits for Electrical and Computer Engineers__. Instructor: [Prof. Cliford Pollock](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/clifford-r-pollock). <br> I was responsible for grading the students' homework and laboratory reports as well as holding office hours each week.
