Jimy Encomendero is currently a Ph.D. student and researcher working in the School of <a href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece" target="\_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target="\_blank">Cornell University</a>. Originally from Perú, he received his B.S. degree in Electronics Engineering from <a href="https://www.uni.edu.pe" target="\_blank">Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería</a> and his M.S. degree in <a href="https://ee.nd.edu" target="\_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> from the <a href="https://www.nd.edu" target="\_blank">University of Notre Dame</a>.

Jimy's current research interests focus on the design, epitaxial growth, and fabrication of III-Nitride semiconductor quantum heterostructures. He has contributed to the current understanding of electronic quantum phenomena in polar resonant tunneling heterostructures and their practical device applications. He has demonstrated the first III-Nitride resonant tunneling oscillator, which has been featured in the cover of _Applied Physics Letters_. He is the author of several publications in scientific journals including _Physical Review X_, _Physical Review Applied_, and the _Journal of Applied Physics_. He has presented his work in multiple conferences including EMC, IWN, ICNS and ICPS. He is also the recipient of the _2018 NIST Student Award_.
