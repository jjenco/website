We have uncovered the physics of electronic resonant tunneling transport in GaN/AlN RTDs! Our paper, published in _Physical Review Applied_, has been highlight as an __Editor's Suggestion!__ [<a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.11.034032" target="\_blank">DOI</a>] [<a href="{{ '20190313_PRApplied_Broken_Symmetry.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" target="\_blank">PDF</a>].
